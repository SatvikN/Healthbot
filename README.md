## üöÄ Quick Start

This project is fully containerized using Docker, which is the recommended way to run the application.

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose (latest versions recommended)
- Git

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SatvikN/healthbot.git
cd healthbot
```

### 2. Docker-Based Setup (Recommended)

This single command will build the container images, download dependencies, and start all the services (Frontend, Backend, Postgres, Redis, and Ollama).

```bash
# From the project root directory
docker-compose up --build
```

- The `--build` flag is only necessary the first time you run it or after making changes to the `Dockerfile`s or application dependencies.
- To run in the background, use `docker-compose up -d`.

Once the containers are running, the application will be available at:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/api/docs
- **Ollama LLM Service**: http://localhost:11434

To stop the application:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### 3. Manual Local Setup (Without Docker)

If you prefer to run the services manually without Docker, follow these steps.

**Backend Setup**
```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv ../healthbot-backend-env
source ../healthbot-backend-env/bin/activate

# Install dependencies from the root directory's requirements.txt
pip install -r ../requirements.txt

# Start the FastAPI server (from project root)
cd ..
python -m uvicorn backend.app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
```

**Frontend Setup**
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

### 4. Demo Account
The application automatically creates a demo account on startup:
- **Email**: `demo@healthbot.com`
- **Password**: `demo123`

## üîß Development

### Docker Development
For development, you can run the services in detached mode and view logs for a specific service.

```bash
# Start all services in the background
docker-compose up -d

# View logs for the backend
docker-compose logs -f backend

# View logs for the frontend
docker-compose logs -f frontend
```

### Stopping All Services
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Backend Development
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source healthbot-backend-env/bin/activate

# Run with auto-reload (from project root)
python -m uvicorn backend.app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload

# Check API health
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health/
```

### Frontend Development
```bash
# Start development server
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Database Management
```bash
# Reset database (development only)
rm -f healthbot.db

# Database tables are created automatically on startup
```

### Common Commands
```bash
# Clean restart (remove database and restart backend)
pkill -f uvicorn && rm -f healthbot.db && python -m uvicorn backend.app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

# Kill backend process
pkill -f uvicorn
```
